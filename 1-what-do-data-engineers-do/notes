If I were hired to enable data analytics I would first start off with 
finding out which business processes are in need of analytics. 
To do this, I would need to be talking to different parts of the organization or business. 
Gathering their pain points of what they want to analyze will help me start off with a draft of 
what needs to be analyzed or what data is important to these business users. 

After that, I would ask our data team or find data on our database that would help analyze the 
business process that needs analytics. Then I would check if the data provided is sufficient for 
answering or giving analytics to the business user.
